## Features of SEE Electrical Expert V4
 
SEE Electrical Expert V4 has all the standard functions of an electrical CAD software, such as single and multi-line schematics creation and modification, automatic wire numbering, real-time cross-referencing, automatic bill of materials generation, revision management, error checking and more[^2^]. In addition, it also provides some unique features that make it stand out from other electrical CAD software, such as:
 
- **Concurrent Engineering:** This module allows you to work collaboratively on the same project with multiple users, using a central database and a check-in/check-out system. You can also compare different versions of the project and merge changes easily[^1^].
- **3D Panel+:** This module allows you to design 3D electrical panels using a drag-and-drop interface. You can import 3D models of electrical components from online catalogs or other CAD software, and automatically generate wiring diagrams, terminal strips and cable lists from the 3D panel[^1^].
- **Harness Documentation:** This module allows you to design 2D harnesses and automatically route the wires and cables in accordance with the schematics. You can also generate harness drawings, labels, reports and manufacturing data[^1^].
- **Open Data:** This module allows you to modify project data quickly using Excel-like tables. You can edit attributes, symbols, wires, terminals, connectors, cables and more in a batch mode[^1^].
- **Options & Variants:** This module allows you to manage different versions of the same project with different options and variants. You can define rules and conditions for each option or variant, and automatically generate customized schematics, part lists and reports[^1^].
- **Automatic Diagram Generation:** This module allows you to generate electrical diagrams automatically from predefined templates or rules. You can also use SEE Generative View to create dynamic views of your project based on filters or queries[^1^].
- **Communication Interfaces:** SEE Electrical Expert V4 can communicate with other key software packages such as mechanical CAD (Catia, SolidWorks, Creo, NX, Inventor AutoCAD, etc.), PDM (SmarTeam, Windchill, TeamCenter, Solidworks PDM, etc.), ERP (SAP, etc.) and automation and manufacturing software (PLC programming, labeling, panel manufacturing, cable manufacturing, documentation, archiving, cost calculation, etc.)[^1^].

## Benefits of SEE Electrical Expert V4
 
By using SEE Electrical Expert V4 for your electrical projects, you can enjoy many benefits such as:

- **Simplifying the management of complex projects:** SEE Electrical Expert V4 helps you organize your project structure efficiently using folders, sub-projects and references. You can also use macros, symbols libraries and online catalogs to speed up your design process. You can also customize your working environment according to your preferences and standards[^1^].
- **Improving the quality and accuracy of your projects:** SEE Electrical Expert V4 helps you avoid errors and inconsistencies in your projects by using automatic functions such as wire numbering, cross-referencing, error checking and revision management. You can also use built-in design templates and rules to ensure compliance with regulations and standards[^1^].
- **Enhancing the collaboration and communication with other stakeholders:** SEE Electrical Expert V4 helps you share your project data easily with other users or software packages using concurrent engineering, communication interfaces and export/import formats. You can also use hyperlinks, annotations and comments to add information or feedback to your project[^1^].
