In this article, we will review some of the features and benefits of Bome's Midi Translator Pro 1.7.2, the latest version of this versatile tool.
 
## Mouse Emulation on OS X
 
One of the new features of Bome's Midi Translator Pro 1.7.2 is the ability to emulate mouse movement and clicks on OS X, in addition to Windows. This means you can use your MIDI controller to move the cursor, click, drag, scroll, and more on your Mac computer.
 
To use this feature, you need to create an outgoing mouse action in your MIDI Translator project. You can specify the mouse button, the direction and speed of movement, and the number of clicks. You can also use variables to dynamically control the mouse parameters with MIDI messages.
 
## Delay Outgoing Actions
 
Another new feature of Bome's Midi Translator Pro 1.7.2 is the ability to delay outgoing actions directly, without the use of timers. This can be useful for creating complex sequences or synchronizing actions with external events.
 
To use this feature, you need to add a delay parameter to your outgoing action in your MIDI Translator project. You can specify the delay in milliseconds or in musical units (bars, beats, ticks). You can also use variables to dynamically control the delay with MIDI messages.
 
## Improved Performance and Stability
 
Besides adding new features, Bome's Midi Translator Pro 1.7.2 also improves the performance and stability of the software. The developers have fixed some bugs and optimized some processes to make the software run faster and smoother.
